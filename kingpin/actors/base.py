"""Base Actor object class

An Actor object is a class that executes a single logical action
on a resource as part of your deployment structure. For example, you
may have an Actor that launches a server array in RightScale, or you
may have one that sends an email.

Each Actor object should do one thing, and one thing only. Its responsible
for being able to execute the operation in both 'dry' and 'non-dry' modes.

The behavior for 'dry' mode can contain real API calls, but should not make
any live changes. It is up to the developer of the Actor to define what
'dry' mode looks like for that particular action.
