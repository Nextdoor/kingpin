These are common utility Actors that don't really need their own
dedicated packages. Things like sleep timers, loggers, etc.

**Optional Environment Variables**

:URLLIB_DEBUG:
  Set this variable to enable extreme debug logging of the URLLIB requests made
  by the RightScale/AWS actors.  *Note, this is very insecure as
  headers/cookies/etc. are exposed*

    """Parses a kingpin script, instantiates and executes it.

    **Parse JSON/YAML**

    Kingpin JSON/YAML has 2 passes at its validity. Script syntax must be
    valid, with the exception of a few useful deviations allowed by `demjson
    <http://deron.meranda.us/python/demjson/>`_ parser. Main
    one being the permission of inline comments via ``/* this */`` syntax.

    The second pass is validating the Schema. The script will be validated
    for schema-conformity as one of the first things that happens at load-time
    when the app starts up. If it fails, you will be notified immediately.

    Lastly after the JSON/YAML is established to be valid, all the tokens are
    replaced with their specified value. Any key/value pair passed in the
    ``tokens`` option will be available inside of the JSON file as ``%KEY%``
    and replaced with the value at this time.

    In a situation where nested Macro executions are invoked the tokens *do
    not* propagate from outter macro into the inner. This allows to reuse token
    names, but forces the user to specify every token needed. Similarly, if
    environment variables are used for token replacement in the main file,
    these tokens are not available in the subsequent macros.

    **Pre-Instantiation**

    In an effort to prevent mid-run errors, we pre-instantiate all Actor
    objects all at once before we ever begin executing code. This ensures that
    major typos or misconfigurations in the JSON/YAML will be caught early on.

    **Execution**

    `misc.Macro` actor simply calls the `execute()` method of the most-outter
    actor; be it a single action, or a group actor.

    **Options**

    :macro:
      String of local path to a JSON/YAML script.

    :tokens:
      Dictionary to search/replace within the file.

    **Examples**

    .. code-block:: json

         "actor": "misc.Macro",

             "RELEASE": "%RELEASE%"
           }
         }
       }

    **Dry Mode**

    Fully supported -- instantiates the actor inside of JSON with dry=True. The
    behavior of the consecutive actor is unique to each; read their description
    for more information on dry mode.
