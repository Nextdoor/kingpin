/* This script is used to test a race condition where the outer-actor
raises an ActorTimedOut exception moments before the inner-actor raises
the same exception. asyncio.shield() is used in BaseActor.timeout() to
prevent cancellation of the inner task, allowing it to continue running
even after the timeout fires. */
