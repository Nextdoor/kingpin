*Kingpin: the chief element of any system, plan, or the like.*

Kingpin provides 3 main functions:

-  **API Abstraction** - Job instructions are provided to Kingpin via a JSON based DSL (read below). The schema is strict and consistent from one action to another. 
-  **Automation Engine** - Kingpin leverages python's `tornado <http://tornado.readthedocs.org>`_ engine.
-  **Parallel Execution** - Aside from non-blocking network IO, Kingpin can execute any action in parallel with another. (Read group.Async below)
