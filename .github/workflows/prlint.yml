            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº

            We have changed the repository requirements to now use [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
      - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
