    Groups together a series of Actors and executes them synchronously

    **Options**

    :acts:
      An array of individual Actor definitions.

    :contexts:

      This variable can be one of two formats:

      * A list of dictionaries with *contextual tokens* to pass into the actors
        at instantiation time. If the list has more than one element, then
        every actor defined in ``acts`` will be instantiated once for each item
        in the ``contexts`` list.
      * A string that points to a file with a list of contexts, just like the
        above dictionary.
      * (_Deprecation warning, this is going away in v0.4.0. Use the 'str'
        method above!_) A dictionary of ``file`` and ``tokens``. The file
        should be a relative path with data formatted same as stated above. The
        tokens need to be the same format as a Macro actor: a dictionary
        passing token data to be used.


    **Timeouts**

    Timeouts are disabled specifically in this actor. The sub-actors can still
    raise their own `kingpin.actors.exceptions.ActorTimedOut` exceptions, but
    since the group actors run an arbitrary number of sub actors, we have
    chosen to not have this actor specifically raise its own
    `kingpin.actors.exceptions.ActorTimedOut` exception unless the user sets
    the ``timeout`` setting.

    **Examples**

    Creates two arrays ... but sleeps 60 seconds between the two, then
    does not sleep at all after the last one:

    .. code-block:: json

       { "desc": "Clone, then sleep ... then clone, then sleep shorter...",
         "actor": "group.Sync",
         "options": {
           "contexts": [
             { "ARRAY": "First", "SLEEP": "60", },
             { "ARRAY": "Second", "SLEEP": "0", }
           ],
           "acts": [
             { "desc": "do something",
               "actor": "server_array.Clone",
               "options": {
                 "source": "template",
                 "dest": "{ARRAY}"
               }
             },
             { "desc": "sleep",
               "actor": "misc.Sleep",
               "options": {
                 "sleep": "{SLEEP}",
               }
             }
           ]
         }
       }

    Alternatively if no `contexts` are needed you can use the `array` syntax.

    .. code-block:: json

       [
         {
           "actor": "server_array.Clone",
           "options": {
             "source": "template",
             "dest": "%ARRAY%"
           }

           "actor": "misc.Sleep",
           "options": { "sleep": 30 }
         }
       ]

    **Dry Mode**

    Passes on the Dry mode setting to the acts that are called. Does **not**
    stop execution when one of the acts fails. Instead Group actor will finish
    all acts with warnings, and raise an error at the end of execution.

    This provides the user with an insight to all the errors that are possible
    to encounter, rather than abort and quit on the first one.

    **Failure**

    In the event that an act fails, this actor will return the failure
    immediately.  Because the acts are executed in-order of definition, the
    failure will prevent any further acts from executing.

    The behavior is different in the dry run (read above.)
