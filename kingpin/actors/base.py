Base Actor object class

An Actor object is a class that executes a single logical action
on a resource as part of your deployment structure. For example, you
may have an Actor that launches a server array in RightScale, or you
may have one that sends an email.

Each Actor object should do one thing, and one thing only. Its responsible
for being able to execute the operation in both 'dry' and 'non-dry' modes.

The behavior for 'dry' mode can contain real API calls, but should not make
any live changes. It is up to the developer of the Actor to define what
'dry' mode looks like for that particular action.

class EnsurableBaseActor(BaseActor):

    """Base Class for Actors that "ensure" the state of a resource.

    Many of our actors have a goal of ensuring that a particular resource is in
    a given state. This leads to a ton of boiler plate code to "get" the state
    of something, "compare" that to the desired state, and then maybe "set" the
    state.

    This actor provides a framework allowing the user to simply write the
    getters and setters (and optionally compare), and lets the rest of the
    actor handle the order of operations.

    **Required Methods:**

      :`_set_state`: Creates or destroys the resource depending on
                      the 'state' parameter that was passed in.

                      *Note: The 'state' parameter is automatically added to
                      the options. You do not need to define it.*
      :`_get_state`: Gets the current state of the resource.
      :`_set_[option]`: A 'setter' for each option name passed in.
      :`_get_[option]`: A 'getter' for each option name passed in.

    **Optional Methods:**

      :`_precache`: Called before any setters/getters are triggered. Used
                       to optionally populate a cache of data to make the
                       getters faster. For example, if you can make one API
                       call to get all of the data about a resource, then
                       store that data locally for fast access.

      :`_compare_[option]`: Optionally you can write your own comparison
                               method if you're not doing a pure string
                               comparison between the source and destination.
