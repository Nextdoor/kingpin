##### group.Sync

Groups together a series of Actors and executes them synchronously
in the order that they were defined.

**Options**

  * `acts` - An array of individual Actor definitions.
  * `contexts` - A list of dictionaries with _contextual tokens_ to pass into
    the actors at instantiation time. If the list has more than one element,
    then every actor defined in `acts` will be instantiated once for each item
    in the `contexts` list.

**Timeouts**

Timeouts are disabled specifically in this actor. The sub-actors can still
raise their own `ActorTimedOut` exceptions, but since the group actors run an
arbitrary number of sub actors, we have chosen to not have this actor
specifically raise its own `ActorTimedOut` exception unless the user sets the
`timeout` setting.

Examples

    # Creates two arrays ... but sleeps 60 seconds between the two, then
    # does not sleep at all after the last one.
    { "desc": "Clone, then sleep ... then clone, then sleep shorter...",
      "actor": "group.Sync",
      "options": {
        "contexts": [
          { "ARRAY": "First", "SLEEP": "60", },
          { "ARRAY": "Second", "SLEEP": "0", }
        ],
        "acts": [
          { "desc":
            "do something",
            "actor": "server_array.Clone",
            "options": {
              "source": "template",
              "dest": "{ARRAY}"
            }
          },
          { "desc": "sleep",
            "actor": "misc.Sleep",
            "options": {
              "sleep": "{SLEEP}",
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }

**Dry Mode**

Passes on the Dry mode setting to the acts that are called. Does **not** stop
execution when one of the acts fails. Instead Group actor will finish all acts
with warnings, and raise an error at the end of execution.

This provides the user with an insight to all the errors that are possible to
encounter, rather than abort and quit on the first one.

**Failure**

In the event that an act fails, this actor will return the failure immediately.
Because the acts are executed in-order of definition, the failure will
prevent any further acts from executing.

The behavior is different in the dry run (read above.)
