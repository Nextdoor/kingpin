    """High level ELB Actor testing.

    These tests will check two things:
    * Connection to ELB works, and instance count is correct
    * The actor continues waiting if instance count is less than expected

    Requirements:
        You have to create an ELB named kingpin-integration-test and place it
        in the specified region (default us-east-1).
        As with other tests, environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are expected, and the key should have
        permissions to read ELB status.

    Note, these tests must be run in-order. The order is defined by
    their definition order in this file. Nose follows this order according
    to its documentation:

        http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing_tests.html
