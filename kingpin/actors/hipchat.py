The Hipchat Actors allow you to send messages to a HipChat room at stages
during your job execution. The actor supports dry mode by validating that the
configured API Token has access to execute the methods, without actually
sending the messages.

  HipChat API Token

:HIPCHAT_NAME:
  HipChat message from name
