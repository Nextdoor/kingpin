"""
This package provides a quick way of creating custom API clients for JSON-based
REST APIs. The majority of the work is in the creation of a _CONFIG dictionary
for the class. This dictionary dynamically configures the object at
instantiation time with the appropriate @gen.coroutine wrapped HTTP fetch
methods.

See the documentation in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md for more details on how to use
this package to create your own API client.

    This decorator provides a simple retry mechanism that compares the

    might want to throw an InvalidCredentials exception.
